# GALACTIC WARS

**Galactic Wars**, also known as **Space Invaders**, is one of the earliest video games released. The objective of the game is to pan across a screen and shoot descending swarms of aliens, preventing them from reaching the bottom of the screen. It is viewed as a pioneer of modern gaming. It is a very simple game by modern standards, but it was a technological marvel in its time. Typical levels consist of a player piloting a laser cannon to battle columns of descending aliens while using shields to block alien fire. The speed of the alien approach increases as the game progresses, adding to the tension. A bonus alien spaceship appears from time to time, which offers the player an opportunity to score additional points by blowing it up. It was a worldwide success and paved the way for a generation of shooting games that became extremely popular.
